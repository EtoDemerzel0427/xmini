# XMini Interpreter

This is a simple interpreter for the XMini language. It is written in Java as the assignment 1 for the course "Engineering Program Analysis" at UT Austin in Fall 2022.

## How to run
```bash
We provide a bash script to run the interpreter. You can run it by:
$ s <filename>
```
where `<filename>` is the name of the file containing the XMini program.

We also provide a REPL mode. You can run it by:
```bash
$ s
```
Then you can type commands in the command line and press enter to execute them.

If you encounter any permission issues, you can run the following command to give the script execution permission:
```bash
$ chmod +x s
```
